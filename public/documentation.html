    <h3>API goal</h3>
    <p>
      Our movie API is set to build the server-side component of a “movies” web
      application. The web application will provide users with access to
      information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be
      able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of
      their favorite movies.
